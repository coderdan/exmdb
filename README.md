# Exmdb

Library for conveniently working with LMDB, a fast, compact and transactional key-value data store.

This library uses [zambal/elmdb](https://github.com/zambal/elmdb) under the hood, but will provide a higher level interface for Elixir users, including implementations of the `Enumerable` and `Collectable` protocols.

**Not much to see yet. WIP**
